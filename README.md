# cve-2014-7911-exp
exploit for cve-2014-7911; android; java deserialization ;system privilege;ace;

This exp refers to retme7's [exp](https://github.com/retme7/CVE-2014-7911_poc),but the rop chain is different.

And the most important part is [Chunk Spray](https://github.com/GeneBlue/cve-2014-7911-exp/blob/master/heap_spray_layout.jpg).

Hope it will help.
